  ## About Me
Hi, Iâ€™m Kim Nam-Il!
I graduated from Sogang University with a degree in Economics and earned an M.Sc. in Financial Engineering from KAIST.
Iâ€™ve worked at KBS (Korean Broadcasting System) and WorldQuant(a subsidiary of Millennium Management).
Currently, Iâ€™m interested in data science, quantitative analysis, and artificial intelligence.
